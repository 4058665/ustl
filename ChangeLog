Release 0.4-3
	* A ChangeLog! After all these years...
	* SIMD instruction support for fill and copy via gcc vector extensions
	* matrix template (on top of tuple)
		3dNow! instructions are supported for vector transforms.
	* New utility templates
	    absv		- absolute value.
	    sign		- -1 for negative, 0 for 0, 1 for positive
	    abs_distance	- returns an absolute value of the difference.
	    distance		- now returns ptrdiff_t, as in SGI STL.
	    size_of_elements	- useful for working with static arrays in
				  templates; returns sizeof(T) * n.
	    pack_type		- useful for unrolling loops, packs a small
				  type into a big one.
	    alignof		- recommended alignment for a type (uses GCC
				  __alignof__ extension, if available)
	* get_temporary_buffer implemented using alloca and macros
	* Updated rotate to use alloca for small moves.
		This should speed up vector operations, like insert and erase.
	* Fixed copy_backward to actually copy backward rather than reverse.
	* Made resize virtual in memblock to properly handle strings.
	* sostream/sistream will handle wchar_t properly (as utf8 read/write)
	* ustring.cc: fixed multiple wchar_t insert

Release 0.4-2
	* ostringstreams will now correctly resize the buffer as needed.
	* Fixed floating point output
		(well, not really, just switched to using snprintf)
